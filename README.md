# solana-game-game (work in progress)

server & website for explaining & demonstrating the (yet to be completed) developer tool-kit for building gambling and wager-based games on the Solana blockchain

### [back-end](https://github.com/bigbizze/solana-gamble-game/blob/master/back/README.md)

this uses a cloned version of https://github.com/bigbizze/solana-game-contract-io (which in the future will be an npm package) to build a server for playing games using the Solana blockchain

### [front-end](https://github.com/bigbizze/solana-gamble-game/blob/master/front/README.md)

very basic front-end for explaining the idea (MVP), as well as containing the "useSolanaGame" hook file, which will eventually also be broken off into an npm package so developers can easily turn their web application into a gambling game powered by solana
